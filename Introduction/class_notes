AngularJS.

    - AngularJS is a Client Side JavaScript Framework.

    - AngularJS Follows the MVC Design Pattern.

        M - Model (JavaScript Variables)

        V - View  (HTML / HTML5)

        C - Controller (JavaScript Functions)


    - AngularJS Have a So Many Predefined Modules, As a Angular Developer We Can Reuse the Predefined Modules.

        1.ngAnimate

            - used to develop the Animations in Angular Applications.


        2.ngMessages

            - used to handle the client side form validations.


        3.ngStorage

            - used to work with the Storages.

            - we have two types of Storages.

                1.localStorage

                2.sessionStorage


        4.ngRoute

            - used to achieve the Routing in  Single Page Application.

            - ngRoute Module is the Predefined  Module, now a days no body using the ngRoute Module

              because of it's limitations.


        5.ui.router


            - used to handle the Routings in Single Page Applications.

            - ui.router module is the 3rd party module, now a days all most all the projects they are using

              ui.router module in SPA.



        //Develop One Angular Application with the Following Features.

            1.Animations

            2.Storages

            3.Routing (ui.router)

            4.Validations



        index.html
        -

        <!DOCTYPE html>


        <html ng-app="myApp">


            <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.0/angular.min.js"></script>

            <script>
                angular.module("myApp",["ngAnimate","ngStorage","ngMessages","ui.router"]);
            </script>

        </html>



Advantages Of AngularJS.

1.As a Angular Developer We Can Directly Work With the HTML DOM.

    DOM Stands for Document Object Model


2.AngularJS Supports The MVC Design Pattern.

3.AngularJS Supports the Two Way Data Binding

    - Automatic Data Synchronization Between Model and View with the Supervision of Controller

       Called as Two Way Data Binding.

    [Note . Two Way Data Binding also Reduces the Burden on the Server ]

4.AngularJS Supports the Single Page Applications.

    - Loading the Target Templates to Source Template without refreshing the whole source template
      called as Single Page Application.

    - Framework will cache the Templates in Single Page Applicatons , called as Template Cache


5.Open Source Code.

    - As a Developer we can Customize the Framework Accroding to Application Requirement.


Disadvantages Of AngularJS.

1.Secuirity

    By using AngularJS We Are Missing the Secuirity , because we are implementing Business Components

    at client side.


2. Client Should Enable the JavaScript.


3. Understanding the Angular Applications are Difficult , Because of No Coding Standards.



Automation Tools.

1.Bower

    - Bower is the Automation tool , used to download the Dependencies Based on the Application Requirement.

    - Bower Given By The NodeJS.


bower components.

1.bower.json

        - used to maintain the Required Resources to develop web application.

2. .bowerrc

        - used to indicate the path to the resources downloading by using bower.

Ex.

bower.json
-
{
    "name":"durgasoft",
    "dependencies":{
        "angular":"~1.6.0",
        "bootstrap":"~3.3.6"
    }
}




.bowerrc
-
{
    "directory":"bower_components"
}




>bower install
